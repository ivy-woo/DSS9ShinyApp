# Shiny App

This is a repo for the course Developing Data Products on Coursera, the 9th course from the Data Science Specialization. A simple Shiny app is built and the relevant files are made open here.

You find the following files in this repo:

### ui.R and server.R

These are the two R scripts in which the Shiny app is written.

Summary on app:  
a scatter plot on data from the 'swiss' dataset in R is generated based on the independent and dependent variables selected by the app user.
The user can opt to fit a linear regression model to the two variables chosen, with which the regression line will be displayed in the plot and the regression coefficients together with the R-squared value will be calculated.

The Shiny app is deployed on [shinyapp.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/), visit <a href="https://ivywoo.shinyapps.io/shinyapp-swissdata/">https://ivywoo.shinyapps.io/shinyapp-swissdata/</a> to play with the app.

### SlidifyPresentation/presentation.{Rmd,html}

A short presentation slide on the Shiny app is made with R Markdown Slidify. The html is generated by knitring the Rmd file.
The slides can be viewed at <a href="https://ivy-woo.github.io/DSS9ShinyApp/SlidifyPresentation/presentation.html">https://ivy-woo.github.io/DSS9ShinyApp/SlidifyPresentation/presentation.html</a>.
